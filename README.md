# Smart-Waste-Management-System

Problem:
Managing waste collection efficiently in urban areas is a challenge. Many cities face issues with overflowing bins, inefficient collection routes, and lack of citizen engagement in waste management.

Solution:
Develop a Smart Waste Management System that uses React.js/Angular and Spring Boot to optimize waste collection, improve citizen reporting, and enhance overall efficiency.
Features:
1. For Citizens:

    Report Overflowing Bins:
        Users can report overflowing bins by selecting their location on a map and uploading images.
        Status updates on reported bins (e.g., "In Progress", "Resolved").
    Schedule Bulk Waste Pickup:
        Citizens can request bulk waste pickups for large items like furniture.
        Integration with calendar to select available slots.

2. For Waste Management Teams:

    Dashboard:
        View a map of bins with real-time status (e.g., "Full", "Empty").
        Assign collection tasks to nearby vehicles.

    Route Optimization:
        Automatically generate optimized routes for waste collection vehicles.

    Analytics:
        Display statistics (e.g., waste collected, number of complaints, most problematic areas).

3. General Features:

    Notifications:
        Notify citizens about scheduled pickups or delays.
        Alerts for waste management teams when a bin is full.

    Authentication:
        Role-based authentication (Admin, Team Member, Citizen).

    Real-time Updates:
        WebSocket or polling for real-time bin status updates and task progress.

Hereâ€™s a project idea for a React.js/Angular frontend and Spring Boot backend that addresses a real-life problem:

    Authentication:
        Role-based authentication (Admin, Team Member, Citizen).

    Real-time Updates:
        WebSocket or polling for real-time bin status updates and task progress.

Tech Stack:
Frontend (React.js/Angular):

    Map Integration: Use libraries like Leaflet or Google Maps for geolocation.
    State Management: Redux or Context API for React; NgRx for Angular.
    UI Components: Material-UI, Bootstrap, or Angular Material for a clean design.

Backend (Spring Boot):

    API Development: RESTful APIs for handling bin status, reports, and tasks.
    Database: Use PostgreSQL/MySQL for data storage.
    Task Scheduling: Use Quartz Scheduler for periodic tasks like notifying teams.
    Real-time Features: Use WebSocket for instant updates.

Optional Enhancements:

    IoT Integration: Use IoT sensors to update bin status in real-time.
    Machine Learning: Predict waste overflow patterns based on historical data.



How It Solves the Problem:

    Efficiency: Optimizes waste collection routes, saving time and fuel.
    Transparency: Citizens can track complaints and bin status.
    Sustainability: Encourages responsible waste management.



    Steps to Build:

    Backend:
        Set up Spring Boot project.
        Build REST APIs for CRUD operations (bins, complaints, routes).
        Configure database for storage.

    Frontend:
        Build components for reporting, dashboards, and notifications.
        Integrate maps for location-based features.
        Connect to the backend via APIs.

    Testing:
        Unit tests for APIs and components.
        End-to-end testing for workflows.

    Deployment:
        Deploy the backend on a cloud service like AWS or Heroku.
        Host the frontend using Netlify or Vercel.
